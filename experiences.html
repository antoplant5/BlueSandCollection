                            Stand up paddle boarding is an inclusive sport allowing just about anyone to get up and paddling
                            on their first time out! It offers a fun way to play on the water, with the added benefit of
                            a full-body workout. And, since you stand at full height on your board, it gives you a unique
                            vantage point for viewing what’s down under the water and out on the horizon!<br><br>
                            You can choose to paddle board right in front of our properties (if conditions are appropriate
                            and safe) or book an Eco-tour with one of our preferred partners!<br><br>
                            We can connect you with board rentals & lessons with experienced instructors and guides.

                            10 minute drive from the house.! Survival Beach is a long stretch of sand in Aguadilla, with
                            some really neat rock formations along the shoreline. It is only a 30 to 40-minue hike along
                            a path through the trees and over rocks at the beach. It is not super easy, but most people
                            should be able to make the trek to enjoy this place. You must park at "surfers beach" then
                            venture into the woods! Locals are nice and welcoming so make sure to ask them what's the
                            best path to follow. <br>
                            <strong>How to get there?</strong>

                            immersed in the mountains of our tropical forests.. For those who seek the thrill, some of the
                            audacious locals jump from the inside of the waterfall! If you want more, to the right of the
                            main waterfall you will find a dirt path that borders the river and takes you up to another
